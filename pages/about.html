                    It was in the fall of 2019 that Caleb, pursuing degrees in both astrophysics and music
                    composition, first referred to himself as an “astrophysicist.”
                    He has been insufferable ever since.

                <p class="card-text">
                    From his early days, Caleb has been fascinated by the intersection of curiosity and
                    creativity. He's written books, movies, sonatas, and research papers that all share
                    the same purpose: to ask a question about the universe, and then try to find a fun
                    way to answer it.

                    When he isn't creating stories, sounds, or science, Caleb can be
                    found desperately trying to keep his basil plant alive,
                    working on his spicy food tolerance,
                    and writing about himself in the third person.

                    Feel free to ask about Caleb's stint playing bass in a bluegrass band,
                    his incredible experience in the Sesame Street Writers' Room, or the year
                    he scored five short films in two months. You could even ask him what that
                        trophy is for 🤔.
